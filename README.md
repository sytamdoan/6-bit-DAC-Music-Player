# 6-bit-DAC-Music-Player

This was the first project for class Embedded System 3. I'm instructed to build a 2-2R DAC circuit that outputs a musical note. The project is implemented using the TM4C123G microcontroller. The project has 2 modes, an auto play mode and a manual play mode. In the auto play mode, the code cycles through 3 songs, twinkle twinkle little star, Mary had a little lamb, and happy birthday to you. In manuel play mode, the user can play the notes and change the octave. See video for a demonstration.
